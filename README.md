# Cadence — Timeslot Booking

A calm way to publish the windows you are free and let clients claim one. A real,
buildable app on the Hanzo stack — fork it on [hanzo.app](https://hanzo.app) and
deploy live on Hanzo Cloud.

- **UI** — [`@hanzo/gui`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@hanzo/gui) (the Hanzo
  design system) under Vite + React 19. A light, single-accent scheduler; no
  Tailwind, no second kit.
- **Auth** — [`@hanzo/iam`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@hanzo/iam), OAuth2
  **PKCE** against [hanzo.id](https://hanzo.id). No local passwords — IAM owns
  every credential interaction.
- **Data** — [`@hanzo/base`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@hanzo/base), the
  IAM-native, org-scoped data plane. Slots and bookings are real Base
  collections.

Three views cover the whole loop:

- **Book** — open slots laid out as a calm agenda, one day per row. Pick a slot,
  add your name/email/note, confirm.
- **Bookings** — every reservation joined to its time, with cancel.
- **Availability** — publish slots, open/close them, remove the ones you don't
  want offered.

"Booked" is **derived** from the bookings collection (a booking pointing at a
slot id), never stored twice — so every action is a single write and the two
collections can't drift.

## Stack (pinned)

| Package | Version |
| --- | --- |
| `react` / `react-dom` | `^19.2.4` |
| `@hanzo/gui` + `@hanzogui/config` | `7.3.0` |
| `@hanzo/iam` | `^0.13.1` |
| `@hanzo/base` | `^0.2.1` |
| `vite` | `^6` (`@vitejs/plugin-react`) |
| `typescript` | `5.9.3` |

## Run it

```sh
npm install
npm run dev        # http://localhost:5173
npm run build      # tsc --noEmit && vite build  ->  dist/
npm run preview    # serve the production build (SPA fallback on)
```

Out of the box it runs against **live** Hanzo (hanzo.id + api.hanzo.ai) — no
config needed to see the sign-in flow. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` to point at
a different environment.

## Environment contract

Only `VITE_`-prefixed vars reach the browser (this is a static SPA — there is no
server). Defaults in parentheses.

| Var | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `VITE_HANZO_IAM_URL` (`https://hanzo.id`) | OIDC issuer. |
| `VITE_HANZO_CLIENT_ID` (`hanzo-app`) | IAM application (`<org>-<app>`). Its redirect-URI list must allow this deploy's `/auth/callback` — see **Ambient IAM**. |
| `VITE_HANZO_REDIRECT_URI` (`${origin}/auth/callback`) | PKCE redirect. |
| `VITE_HANZO_BASE_URL` (`https://api.hanzo.ai`) | Browser-reachable Hanzo Base data plane. Deploy injects the provisioned URL. |
| `VITE_HANZO_API_URL` / `VITE_HANZO_API_KEY` | Optional — only if the app calls the Hanzo LLM gateway. Unused here; never commit a real key. |

## How auth works — ambient IAM

`login()` starts an OAuth2 **PKCE S256** redirect to hanzo.id; hanzo.id returns
to `/auth/callback`, where `handleCallback()` exchanges the code for tokens
(stored in `localStorage`, refresh-aware via `offline_access`). Every deployed
app is a static site at `<slug>.hanzo.app`; there is **no server token** — the
SPA authenticates the user in the browser and carries the resulting IAM JWT to
Base. "Ambient" means the app just reads the signed-in user via that token.

The one deploy requirement: the IAM client (`VITE_HANZO_CLIENT_ID`) must list
this origin's `/auth/callback` as an allowed redirect URI. Register a
`https://*.hanzo.app/auth/callback` wildcard on the shared client so every
forked app works, or register a dedicated `hanzo-booking-timeslot` client.

## How data works — Base from `schema.sql`

[`schema.sql`](./schema.sql) is the app's `databaseSchema` (SQL DDL). On publish,
Hanzo Cloud translates each `CREATE TABLE` into a Hanzo Base collection
(`provisionBaseFromDDL`, additive + idempotent). Base manages
`id`/`created`/`updated`/`owner`/`org`, stamps `owner`+`org` from the verified
IAM principal, and applies the rule `@request.auth.org_id = org` so a teammate in
your org sees the row and other orgs cannot. Two collections:

- **`slots`** `(start, end, open)` — a publishable window; `open` is your toggle.
- **`bookings`** `(slot, name, email, note)` — a reservation tied to a slot id.

At runtime the three views read/write these through `@hanzo/base/react`
(`useQuery`/`useMutation`) carrying the IAM token. Keep `schema.sql` in lockstep
with what the app reads/writes.

## Deploy — Hanzo Cloud

[`hanzo.yml`](./hanzo.yml) declares a static build (`npm run build` → `dist/`,
served at `<slug>.hanzo.app`) plus the Base schema to provision and the env to
inject. Do **not** build a container image locally — Hanzo Cloud owns builds and
deploys. CI here only proves the template compiles green.
